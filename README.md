Goal - The goal of the project is to compare the performance of the machine learning algorithms.  <br/>
Problem Statement- The dataset had 14 variables which are listed in the later part of the report. <br/>
In this, medv: median price of the house is the target variable. Using rest feature variables and machine learning algorithms, <br/>
